# Excel-Workbook

Development of a workbook to teach excel.

Part One: Data Science Fundamentals (1H)

1.1 Getting Started with Data
Understand what you have and start asking yourself questions and from there you can make incredible things for business and organizations to drive improvements.
In this course we will work ways of working with data and basic concepts that will be explored later.
First: getting the data. Data comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes from a variety of places:
Files, database, immediate data.
You need to use some sort of  tool to manipulate, work with, clean up and start to analyze it:
Excel, R, Python.
Rosie, orange juice seller.

1.2 Working with data in excel
Import usind data – from text file
Show how to import data this way.
Showing how to, why and possibilities of fomating as a table.
Sometimes you need to derive columns, create derived data. What new colums, new data we could and should bring!!!
Sales; revenue.
Is there issues with the data!!!
What are they!!!
Duplicates and how to deal with them.
Data – remove duplicates
Completing missing values.
Show how to use filters and insert slicers
Isert – slicer

1.3 Exploring Data
A simple but good example of how to acquire, clean and work with it in excel which is a powerful toll to explore our data. Start to learn from what we have. You need to know what you are loking for.
Types of questions we can ask of the data:
Descriptive: how many I sell, how much is my revenue;
Associative: is tempeture is a factor in how many drinks I sell;
Comparative: Do I sold more lemonades or orange juice;
Predictive: we can use it to predict the number of sells in an given day.

1.4 Demo - Exploring Data in Excel
Count function. Kinds of cells. Function to get the media. Function to max. Show list of functions.
Its nice to see the data more visually with some outliers. When she made more or less money.
Conditional formatting: Data bars. Color scales. Icons.
Outliers are important because you can visualize some correlations or identify an data error. First and last ones. Sparklines: graphs for one column.

1.5 Introduction to Data Visualization
Make graphs and charts to have a true representation of what is going on with the data. The power of the graphs is to get things together and see how one thing relates with other.
Axis, y axis and x axis. Label axis with what they represent. Y vs x.  scale, what is one of the most important decisions to take doing a graph because the scale need to be appropriate and avoid distortions. The origin point. Form of mark points in the graph. The line drawed joining the points. Show line and bar chart. Are diferent types of charts and is important to chose the one tha best fits to represent the data that needs to be represented, which some times happens that being more than just one kind of graph.

1.6 Demo visualizing Data in Excel
Create the graph revenue over time. Add a tittle and axis names. Insert a trendline. Add a second serie of values, temperature. Design of the graph. Add a legend to the graph. The data are in different scales. Example of normalize data to get a more accurate picture of whats is going on. Its important when putting multiple things in the same graph.
Make a bar graph with date and sells of lemon and orange. Change the graph tipe.
Make a pizza graph and expose that pie charts is not very used. They are limited for data science but used at market.
Scarterplot chart, commonly used in data science. Compare different values and used to find correlations. More data is better and when we see a structure it indicates a correlation. These graphs is more from market than data science or statistcis.
Important for statistcs: histogram. We need finer inside of whats going on because we need to understand the shape of the data. Its important from an statistic point of view because almost statistcs we use assume an normal distribution. Later distribution will be discussed.
Box and whisker chart: x is the average. The top represents the third quartile. The button represents the first quartile. The whiskers shows the maximum value and the minimum value. Visual representation in a different way of where the data lies. The difference is statistic relevant, its meaningful. If the data is differs but is very close we need to use some statistics to find out if this differences are significant.

1.7 Slicing and Dicing Data
There is a difference between the charts used in the traditional business based chart and the statistical based chart. Business intelligence. Start to look three dimensional instead of two dimensions.
Example and contrast between two and three dimension graph representation.

1.8 Demo pivot tables and pivot charts
Show how to insert a pivot table.
Show how to manipulate the pivot table.
Insert and manipulate a pivot graph.
